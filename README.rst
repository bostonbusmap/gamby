gamby README
==================

This repository contains (or will contain) the Arduino libraries for use with
the GAMBY LCD/Game shield. 

The initial test sketches will be checked into the /examples/ subdirectory.
As the actual libraries are developed, code will be moved out of the sketches
and into the actual .cpp/.h code; the test sketches will shrink and
eventually disapper.
